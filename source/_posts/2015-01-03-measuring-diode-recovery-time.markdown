After assembling a full-wave rectifier out of some [1A7][] 1kV-rated diodes, I noticed that it
does not, in fact, rectify. I speculated that the diodes I used have a recovery time too high.
Since it was not specified in the datasheet, I decided to measure it myself, which I
describe in this note.

Background
----------

Before a diode can conduct current forward, a space charge needs to be established
across the p-n junction. After the external voltage is reversed, the diode will
conduct in reverse for a certain time before the charge carriers recombine.

The following is a typical measurement circuit used in industry:

Simulation
----------

The following is the test circuit I use and simulation of its behavior:

Measurement
-----------

The circuit implements a pulse generator using a MOSFET half-bridge with
the fall time of ~15ns and uses regular 0.125W thin film resistors.
It is simple and reuses components I already had.
The blue channel probes _pulse_ and the yellow one probes _common_.

The DUT has a recovery time of about 7.5Âµs, which of course makes it useless in a rectifier
working at ~350kHz. (The cursors do not highlight the entire recovery interval.)

For comparison, these are the waveforms corresponding to 1N4148 (4ns recovery time) tested
using the same circuit:

My 150MHz oscilloscope probe is too crude to capture the pulse, not to mention
there is too much parasitic inductance in the circuit anyway.
