I found it convenient to have a table with a grid of nuts for screwing down the workpieces that could double as victim material. In this note I describe how to simply make such a table out of HDPE.

Introduction
------------

My first prototype used a plywood board, however, that doesn't work well with water as coolant; also, plywood tends to deform in unexpected and non-uniform ways. HDPE is cheap, easily machined, works well as victim material, and resists deformation well.

Tools
-----

jig saw
: DEXTER IC400JS

jig saw blade
: [Bosch T301CD](http://www.boschtools.com/Products/Accessories/Pages/BoschAccessoryDetail.aspx?pid=T301CD)

Materials
---------

HDPE sheet, 300x300x12.7mm
: [generic](https://archive.today/17vTG)

Process
-------

First, sheet was cut to fit CNC3020T's table of 300x200mm using a jig saw.
