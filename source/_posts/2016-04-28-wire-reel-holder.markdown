In order to store and dispense wire conveniently, I made a wire reel holder from PVC pipe. This technique is more generally applicable for prototyping cheap, mechanically weak, easily disassembled frames.

Description

The reel holder looks like this:

The structure is composed of four lengths of pipe: 70mm for legs, 120mm for vertical sections and 380mm for horizontal section.

All joints except the two involving a horizontal section are cemented together. The other joints are left as-is: PVC pipe fits snugly into fittings, and friction holds it against minor disturbances. The forces resulting from unreeling the wire don't break up the structure, and it can be disassembled to add or remove the reels.
