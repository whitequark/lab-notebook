I found it convenient to have a table with a grid of nuts for screwing down the workpieces that could double as victim material. In this note I describe how to simply make such a table out of HDPE.

<!-- more -->

Introduction
------------

My first prototype used a plywood board, however, that doesn't work well with water as coolant; also, plywood tends to deform in unexpected and non-uniform ways. HDPE is cheap, easily machined, works well as victim material, and resists deformation well.

Tools
-----

jig saw
: DEXTER IC400JS

jig saw blade
: [Bosch T301CD](http://www.boschtools.com/Products/Accessories/Pages/BoschAccessoryDetail.aspx?pid=T301CD)

drill press
: PRACTYL 500W with 16mm collet

d=6mm wood drill bit
: generic

CNC mill
: [CNC3020T](http://www.freezepage.com/1395478161OWYSYNBZGX)

d={1, 3.175}mm flat endmill
: generic

Materials
---------

HDPE sheet, 300x300x12.7mm
: [generic](https://archive.today/17vTG)

{M6x12 screw, M6x40 bolt, M6 nut, M6 wing-nut, M6 washer} Ã—6
: generic

Process
-------

Sheet was cut to fit CNC3020T's table of 300x200mm using a jig saw.

### Mounting holes

Sheet was marked for drilling on a drill press using d=1mm endmill. Sheet wasn't drilled on the mill itself to avoid crashing the endmill into the table.

Marking was done using the following G-code script. Origin corresponds to the top of sheet, center of nearest leftmost mounting hole.

After drilling, pockets for screw heads were made. Initially, commands for milling first and last pocket were commented out and the sheet was attached using a M6x40 bolt in the T-slot, washer and a wingnut. After that, the sheet was reattached properly, i.e. using M6x12 screw and a nut in the T-slot, and the remaining pockets were milled.
