In this note I describe a simple and convenient arrangement of an E12 resistor set that, crucially, takes very little space.

<!-- more -->

I used to have all my resistors in a box like this:

<%= lightbox '/images/resistor-set/horror.jpeg' %>

Searching for the right one could take minutes. So, I decided to arrange them in 12 boxes based on 1st/2nd digit:

<%= lightbox '/images/resistor-set/boxes.jpeg' %>
<%= lightbox '/images/resistor-set/organized.jpeg' %>

Finding the right multiplier is a matter of seconds. Another good result is that used resistors that are returned into the box are just as easily accessible as the new ones.
