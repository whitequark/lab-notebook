I took some microphotographs of a Nokia 3220 (RH-37) transflective LCD using an Amscope ME300TZ-2L-3M metallurgical microscope. These microphotographs were taken on an intact LCD, i.e. transmitted light images were acquired by shining a flashlight through the entire LCD stackup (the built-in diascopic light source is not powerful enough); the 90° reflected light images were acquired using the built-in episcopic light sources, and the 45° reflected light images were acquired using a similar flashlight.
